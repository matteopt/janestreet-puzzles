## Notes

Some geometry code is adapted from `gloss` ([hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/gloss),
[git](https://github.com/benl23x5/gloss)) to support operations on `(Fractional a) => V2 a` from
`linear`.

This code is found in [FractionalOps.hs](./app/FractionalOps.hs) and licensed as follows:
